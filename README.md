# Nx Integrated Monorepo Playground - React & Next.js

## (1) Get Started

```bash
yarn nx serve react-my-playground
yarn nx test react-my-playground

# alternative
yarn nx run react-my-playground:test

# clear cache
yarn nx reset
```

## (2) Create a new library

We can specify the collection explicitly, `nx g @nx/react:library ...`. `nx g lib` works, too because we have the library in `nx.json`. `nx g lib` will search for library in the nx.json config.

```bash
yarn nx g lib common --directory=libs/components
```

## Notes

## Setting up this repo

# Setting up this repo

```bash
npx create-nx-workspace new

##### the option to set this up
NX   Let's create a new workspace [https://nx.dev/getting-started/intro]

âœ” Which stack do you want to use? Â· react
âœ” What framework would you like to use? Â· none
âœ” Integrated monorepo, or standalone project? Â· integrated
âœ” Application name Â· new
âœ” Which bundler would you like to use? Â· vite
âœ” Test runner to use for end to end (E2E) tests Â· cypress
âœ” Default stylesheet format Â· css
âœ” Do you want Nx Cloud to make your CI fast? Â· skip
```

```bash
yarn nx add @nx/next
yarn nx g @nx/next:app next-app

yarn nx g @nx/react:app react-app

# https://nx.dev/nx-api/storybook
yarn nx add @nx/storybook
yarn nx g @nx/storybook:configuration design-system # set it up with @storybook/react-vite and got error: Cannot find configuration for 'design-system'

# https://nx.dev/nx-api/react/generators/storybook-configuration
# Neither works ðŸ˜¢
yarn nx g @nx/react:storybook-configuration --name=design-system
yarn nx g @nx/react:storybook-configuration design-system

# this kinda worked...
# it created storybook in the react-app project because I chose
# For which project do you want to generate Storybook configuration? Â· react-app
yarn nx g @nx/react:storybook-configuration
```

### (1) Commands from auto-generated README.md

```bash
# Commands from auto generated README.md
npx nx serve new # Start the dev server
npx nx build new # Build the new app.
npx nx <target> <project> <...options> # To execute tasks with Nx
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> # Run multiple targets
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2> # -p to filter projects
npx nx graph # show the graph of the workspace -> see https://nx.dev/core-features/explore-graph
```

### (2) Nx Tasks

https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks

Nx tasks can be
(1) created from existing package.json scripts,
(2) inferred from tooling configuration files (https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks),
(3) or defined in a project.json file.

Nx will merge all three sources together to determine the tasks for a particular project.

### (3) Add more plugins

We can just add plugins to the workspace. `@nx/vite` comes with vite tests by default. So, we can just add jest test.

```bash
yarn add @nx/jest
```

### (4) Generating Projects

```bash
yarn nx generate @nx/react:app myapp
```

### (5) Steps that I used to migrate `react-my-playground` into this monorepo.

(1) Run Nx command to get the repo ready.

```bash
# We need jest plugin: https://nx.dev/nx-api/jest
yarn add @nx/jest
# then generate react-my-playground (g stands for generate)
yarn nx g @nx/react:app apps/react-my-playground
# then set up tailwind
yarn nx g @nx/react:setup-tailwind react-my-playground
# Configure jest
yarn nx g @nx/jest:configuration --project react-my-playground
```

Add `setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/src/setupTests.ts'],` to `apps/react-my-playground/jest.config.ts` so that the test uses react-testing-library.

(2) Copy & Paste the entire code from from `react-my-playground`. Not the config.

(3) Add missing dependencies by yarn install at the root level.

```bash
yarn add clsx zod styled-components msw formik
yarn add @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

## Troubleshooting

Jest doesn't run by using what Nx doc says.

- (1) Setup project

```bash
cd apps
nx g @nx/react:application
nx g @nx/jest:configuration --project=jest-setup

# this runs when I remove css import
yarn nx run jest-setup:test
```

- (2) configure jest-dom with testing library
  Then, add `setupTests.ts` in `src`.

```ts
import '@testing-library/jest-dom'
```

Then add this line in `jest.config.ts`.

```ts
 setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/src/setupTests.ts'],
```

- (3) Add css module & jest-dom types

Add this line in `tsconfig.spec.json`

```json
{
...
// jest and node types are added by default
 "types": ["jest", "node",
    // these two lines should be added
    "@nx/react/typings/cssmodule.d.ts",
    "@testing-library/jest-dom"
    ]
}
```

We also need to add `"src/**/*.spec.tsx"` in includes in `tsconfig.spec.json`. Otherwise,

For the react-my-playground project, I set the compiler option `"jsx": "react"`. It has to be `"jsx":"react-jsx"` .
